A talk from Full Stack Fest 2015 (![](http://fullstackfest.com/))

I recently saw the talk ‘Nothing is Something’ by Sandi Metz and something caught my eye - the idea that Ruby doesn’t need the ‘if’ keyword. This got me thinking: what else could we remove from the language without making it less powerful? In this talk I take this idea and push it to breaking point. Along the way we’ll learn a lot about expressiveness, the limits of computation, the nature of programming and why we shouldn’t try to create pure OO languages.
